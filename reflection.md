What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was not too difficult, but it had a very rocky start. I got a lot of help on the assignment, from TAs, a CS major friend, and office hours, which I think was really important for completing the assignment. In CS 110, I was used to the assignments taking me a maximum 2 hours, where this was a much different time commitment. I like that the assignment was a little more challenging and I feel like I learned alot from it. I think I have a good understanding of what a class is and how to use them effectively when coding in python. However, I would tell another student coming into this course from 110 that the assignments are going to be more difficult and you shouldnâ€™t wait to get started on them. 

First resubmit: 
I changed the names of the buy and sell functions to match what they were supposed to be.
